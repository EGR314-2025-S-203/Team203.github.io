    actor W as WebUser
    participant Brendan as Web Handler
    participant Zack as Motor Controller
    participant Carter as Audio Processor
    actor I as In-Person User

    %% In-Person Interaction
    I->>Carter: Speak into microphone
    Carter->>Brendan: Send pitch data (frequency in Hz)
    Carter->>Zack: Send pitch data for motor control
    Brendan->>Carter: Request pitch update (sync check)
    Zack->>Carter: Request pitch update (motor sync)
    Zack->>I: Move motor to simulate pitch wavelength

    %% Web Sync
    Brendan->>W: Upload pitch data + graph (Hz & waveform)
    W->>Brendan: Send target pitch or correction ("target = 440 Hz")
    Brendan->>Carter: Relay web pitch feedback
    Brendan->>Zack: Notify motor controller of web target
``` 

This communication process demonstrates real-time bidirectional interaction between the physical String Machine and the web interface. When the in-person user speaks into the microphone, Carter extracts the pitch (in Hz) and sends it to both Brendan and Zack. Zack uses this data to generate a physical response by adjusting the stepper motor to match the pitchâ€™s corresponding wavelength. Brendan formats the detected pitch and waveform data into a visual representation and uploads it to the web for remote viewing. Meanwhile, the WebUser can interact with the system by sending a target pitch or correction (e.g., "target = 440 Hz"), which Brendan routes back to Carter and Zack to adjust processing logic and motor behavior accordingly. This two-way link enables synchronized physical and digital feedback, providing both remote and local users with a seamless educational experience.
