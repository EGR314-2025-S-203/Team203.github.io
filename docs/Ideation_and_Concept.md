## Team Ideation and Concept Generation

Goal of our exhibit:

For our teams project, our goal is to be able to demonstrate a concept. We want to be able to do something that allows people to see things that are either too small or not visible in a way that is physically observable. We have liked the ideas of things such as magnetic fields, the light spectrum, and sound waves, all of which are things that are always around us in daily life, however they are not seen or thought of much. We want our project to be something that is interactive as well. so it involves button pressed or sound recognition.

Audience for our exhibit:

Our intended user for this project is K-12 students. We want to help them to be able to have a better understanding and interest in things such as science, technology, engineering, or math skills. The goal is for audience to not need to have a lot of previous knowledge on our subject as we want to create a project that can help teach both basics, but still be interesting to those with prior knowledge.
