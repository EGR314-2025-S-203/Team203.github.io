## Team Organization:

### Charter Statement:

>Our team’s charter statement reflects the shared goals and aspirations we developed through collaborative discussions about the purpose and direction of our project. 

After a focused 10-minute session to define our objectives, we identified key success metrics that go beyond achieving an academic grade. These goals serve as the foundation for our work and ensure alignment with our personal and professional aspirations.

### Team Charter Statement:

As a team of third-year engineering students in EGR314, our primary mission is to design and build a reliable, interactive educational product that engages K–8 students in understanding sound waves through hands-on exploration. Our product—the String Machine—translates children's voice pitch into a visual and physical string vibration using microphone input, stepper motors, and embedded control logic. While the course provides a structured foundation, our goals extend well beyond the grade.

We believe a successful outcome includes:

1. **Creating a fully functional, robust physical prototype** that performs real-time pitch detection and mechanical wavelength generation accurately and consistently.
2. **Designing for audience impact**, ensuring the system is intuitive and engaging for children, educators, and informal science settings such as museums or STEM fairs.
3. **Building a strong technical portfolio piece** that each team member can showcase in future job interviews, internship applications, or graduate school portfolios.
4. **Mastering embedded systems integration** through practical use of UART, SPI, PCB design, and sensor-motor interfacing—developing real-world engineering skills through iteration.
5. **Demonstrating collaborative engineering practices**, including documentation, Git version control, project management (e.g., Gantt tracking), and professional communication.

Ultimately, our team sees this experience as a springboard into our careers. Whether in robotics, mechatronics, or STEM outreach, this project allows us to strengthen both our technical abilities and our ability to work as a cohesive team on a multidisciplinary engineering challenge. We aim not only to fulfill the course requirements but to produce something we are proud to exhibit publicly and refine beyond the semester.


## Roles and Responsibilities

We commit to designing and delivering a product that not only fulfills the requirements of the course but also exemplifies our collective dedication to innovation, precision, and impactful problem-solving. Our aim is to enhance our engineering expertise, create a portfolio-worthy design, and contribute meaningfully to the field of scientific exploration.

To ensure effective team coordination and equitable contribution, we have defined key roles based on Table 2 and added one additional technical role specific to our project’s needs. The roles are initially assigned but will rotate periodically so that each member gains experience in various aspects of project execution.

### Table 2: Project Roles and Duties

| **Role**              | **Duties**                                                                                     | **Initial Member** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Meeting Leader         | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs meetings | Brendan             |
| Meeting Recorder       | Takes meeting minutes, tracks attendance, and records assigned action items                  | Brendan             |
| Assignment Leader      | Coordinates the team's work on assignments and ensures submission to Canvas on time          | Carter              |
| Project Monitor        | Tracks the team's progress relative to the Gantt chart and reminds members of deadlines       | Zack                |
| Technical Integrator   | Oversees integration of hardware and software components and manages testing/debugging        | Zack                |

### Process for Role Assignment and Rotation

- **Role Rotation Frequency:** Project roles will be rotated every 2–3 weeks or after each major milestone, ensuring all members gain experience with different leadership and coordination duties.
  
- **Role Assignment Method:** Roles will be initially assigned based on each member’s strengths and preferences. Role changes will be discussed and agreed upon as a team during weekly meetings.
  
- **Team Support:** Team members are expected to assist each other in meeting their responsibilities, especially when one member is overloaded or encounters technical obstacles. Collaboration and open communication will be emphasized to maintain momentum.
  
- **Adjusting Roles:** If a team member is unable to fulfill their role due to schedule conflicts or project scope changes, the team will reassign roles during a meeting through open discussion and consensus.

- **Tracking Progress:** The Project Monitor will maintain and update the Gantt chart and weekly task tracker (Google Sheets), which will be reviewed during meetings to ensure we’re on track. We will also use a shared team drive to organize deliverables and version control for code and schematics.

- **Technical Task Assignment:** Technical responsibilities will be divided based on prior experience and interest. For example, one member may lead microcontroller programming while another focuses on PCB layout or sensor integration. Tasks will be documented and agreed upon in team meetings, with progress shared during weekly check-ins.

### Supporting Context:

Through open and candid discussions, we recognized that our success is best measured by more than just academic performance. By identifying shared ambitions—such as demonstrating engineering proficiency, creating a tangible addition to our portfolios, and fostering professional growth—we ensured our charter aligns with both immediate project goals and our long-term career objectives. Each team member contributed to shaping the charter, making it a reflection of our unified vision.

### Product Mission Statement:

The product mission statement defines the distilled purpose and function of the scientific device we aim to create. While our project is still in its early stages, we leveraged our initial brainstorming to outline the key purpose of our product: to prove a scientific theory effectively and meaningfully.

>Our mission is to design an innovative and reliable device that validates a scientific theory through precise data collection and analysis. This product will be accessible, robust, and demonstrative of cutting-edge engineering solutions, showcasing our ability to integrate complex concepts into practical applications.

### Supporting Context:

As a team, we aligned on the importance of creating a product that serves a clear and impactful purpose. Our discussions emphasized leveraging each member’s strengths to ensure the product’s reliability and usability. By focusing on accessibility and precision, we aim to produce a tool that not only meets the academic expectations of this course but also resonates with real-world scientific and engineering standards.
