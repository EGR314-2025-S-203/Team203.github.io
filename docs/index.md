## Team Concept Generation and Design Ideation

Step 1: Background reading

Step 2: Learn about science exhibits

What is the goal of your exhibit? 

Our goal is to create Demonstrating a physical action. Where the kids can press a button and change the string wave into a different type of sound wave

Who is your audience? 

The intended user is K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math. Your goal is to demonstrate

Step 3: Generate Ideas

What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?
Visual Indicators, Instructional Prompts, On-Screen Instructions, and Interactive Demonstrations:

How do you plan on designing your "controls" (see page 4 and 6 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")
Single buttons for each wave so most of the work it done by the code. 

What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?
It will be a factor, but if we build it right, it should last for years to come. The motors that spin the string would be th eonly thing to cause unsafety. 


What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? (see page 5 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")


Ideas or strategies for avoiding each of the five common piftalls mentioned in ("Designing Science Museum Exibits with Multiple Interactive Features: Five Common Pitfalls")

Overloading Users with Too Many Features, Neglecting to Provide Clear Instructions, Failing to Design for Different Levels of Expertise,  Ignoring Physical or Environmental Context, and Overcomplicating the User Interface

Step 4: Sort, Rank, and Group

Step 5: Create a concept sketches (or similar) for your exhibit

Step 6: Presentation
