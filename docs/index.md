This project, developed for the ASU EGR314 Embedded Systems course by third-year engineering students, is an interactive web-enabled educational tool designed to teach K–8 students a scientific concept through physical demonstration. The system captures the pitch of a child’s voice using a microphone sensor, calculates the corresponding sound wavelength, and then recreates that wavelength in real-time using stepper motors to modulate string tension. A visual graph of the wave is also displayed to reinforce the concept. The system integrates key technologies such as MQTT communication, stepper motor control, and sensor data processing, fulfilling all course requirements while delivering a hands-on, engaging learning experience.
